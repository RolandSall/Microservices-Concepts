# Repository Objective

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate coding examples in different languages mainly Java and .NET core. These examples will tackle Microservice's well-known patterns and examples.

Moreover, design patterns examples will be covered within examples that will occur in real-life applications rather than just concepts.
Another aim of this repository is to establish these concepts in the different frameworks and languages possible to help spread knowledge.
